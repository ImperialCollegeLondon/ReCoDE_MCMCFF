    "Ok we can finally start writing and running some tests! Check out the [pytest website](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/getting-started.html) for a tutorial on how to write tests in pytest and head over to the [Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/testing.html) for a great introduction to testing in general. \n",

    "I copied some of the initial tests that we did in chapter 1 into `test_energy.py` installed pytest into my development environment with `pip install pytest`. If you're using conda you need to use `conda install pytest` and now I can run the `pytest` command in the ReCoDE_MCFF directory. Pytest will automatically discover our tests and run them, to do this it relies on their being python files with functions named `test_\\*` which it will run.\n",
    "\n",
    "If that doesn't work and complains it can't find MCFF, try `python -m pytest`, this asks python to find a module and run it, which can be useful to ensure you're running pytest inside the correct environment. I ran into this problem because I used `pip install pytest` into a conda environment when I should have done `conda install pytest`.\n",

    "# Note that only functions whose name begins with test_ get run by pytest\n",
    "def E_prediction_all_the_same(L): \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I will defer to external resources for a full discussion of the philosphy of testing but I generally think of tests as an aid to my future debugging. If I make a change that breaks something then I want my tests to catch that and to make it clear what has broken. As such I generally put tests that check very basic properties of my code early on in the file and then follow them with tests that probe more subtle things or more obscure edges cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "`test_exact_energies` checks that the energies of our exact states come out as we calculated they should in chapter 1. This is testing a very limited space of the possible inputs to `energy` so we'd like to find some way to be more confident that our implementation is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "One was is to test multiple independant implementations against one another: `test_energy_implementations` checks our numpy implementation against our numba one. This should catch implementation bugs because it's unlikely we will make the same such error in both implementations. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_energy_implementations():\n",
    "    for state in states:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However if we have made some logical errors in how we've defined the energy, that error will likely appear in both implememtations and thus won't be caught by this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally what we will do now, is that as we write more code or add new functionality we will add tests to check that functionality."
