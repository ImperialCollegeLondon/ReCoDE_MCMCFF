    "# Adding Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "The main thing we want to be able to do is to take measurements, the code as I have writting it doesn't really allow that because it only returns the final state in the chain. Let's say we have a measurement called `average_color(state)` that we want to average over the whole chain. We could just stick that inside our definition of `mcmc` but we know that we will likely make other measurements too and we don't want to keep writing new versions of our core functionality!\n",

    "## Solution 1\n",
    "So I chatted with my mentors on this project on how to best do this and we came up with a few ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Just save all the states and return them\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this is the states are very big and we don't want to waste all that memory. For an NxN state that uses 8 bit integers (the smallest we can use in numpy) 1000 samples would already use 2.5Gb of memory! We will see later that we'd really like to be able to go a bit bigger than 50x50 and 1000 samples!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Pass in a function to make measurements\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def mcmc(initial_state, steps, T, measurement, energy=energy):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    current_state = initial_state.copy()\n",
    "    E = energy(current_state)\n",
    "    for i in range(steps):\n",
    "        measurements[i] = measurement(state)\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    return measurements\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This could work but it limits how we can store measurements and what shape and type they can be. What if we want to store our measurements in a numpy array? Or what if your measurement itself is a vector or and object that can't easily be stored in a numpy array? We would have to think carefully about what functionality we want."

While you may not have come across generator functions before, you almost certainly will have come across generators, `range(n)` is a generator, `(i for i in [1,2,3])` is a generator. Generator functions are a way to build your own generators, by way of example here is range implemented as a generator function:"
