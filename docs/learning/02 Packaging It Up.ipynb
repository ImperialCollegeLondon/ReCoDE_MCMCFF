But let's quickly go through it: at the top level of most projects you'll find on GitHub (and elsewhere) there are a group of files that describe the project as a whole or provide key project information - not all projects will have all of these files and, indeed, there a variety of other files that you may also see so this is an example of some of the more important files:\n",
    "- `README.md` - An intro to the project\n",
