If you're using conda you need to use `conda install pytest`, and now I can run the `pytest` command in the `mcmc` directory. Pytest will automatically discover our tests and run them, to do this it relies on their being python files with functions named `test_\\*` which it will run.\n",

However, when it's less than 100% we get a smaller p_value and this is saying that we should suspect that maybe the mean is not 0 after all.\n",

    "I won't talk about TDD much here, but it's likely a term you will hear at some point. It essentially refers to the practice of writing tests as part of your process of writing code. Rather than writing all your code and then writing tests for them. You could instead write some or all of your tests upfront and then write code that passes them. \n",

    "While we're doing things that will help keep our code clean and tidy in the future, I would recommend installing a code formatter like `black`. This is a program that enforces a particular formatting style on your code by simply doing it for you. At first this sounds a bit weird, but it has a few benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It makes git diffs as small as possible because formatting changes never show up\n",
    "- It means you never have to discuss with your collaborators about code formatting, something which can waste a lot of time!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I will show you how to set up `black` as a pre-commit hook, this means it runs before you commit anything to git, which is probably the best time to do it. We'll use a helper tool called [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).\n",

    "pip install pre-commit\n",
    "pre-commit sample-config >> .pre-commit-config.yaml # Generate an initial config\n",

    "    -   id: black-jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "And finally `pre-commit install` will make this run every time you commit to git. It's worth running it manually once the first time to check it works: `pre-commit run --all-files`. Running this I immediately got a cryptic error that, on googling, turned out to be that something broke in version 21.12b0 of `21.12b0`. Running `precommit autoupdate` fixed this for me by updated `black` to a later version. Running `pre-commit run --all-files` a second time now gives me:\n",
