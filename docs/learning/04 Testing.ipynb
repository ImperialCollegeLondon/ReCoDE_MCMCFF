If you're using conda you need to use `conda install pytest` and now I can run the `pytest` command in the ReCoDE_MCFF directory. Pytest will automatically discover our tests and run them, to do this it relies on their being python files with functions named `test_\\*` which it will run.\n",

Running this I immediatly got a cryptic error that, on googling, turned out to be that something broke in version 21.12b0 of `21.12b0`. Running `precommit autoupdate` fixed this for me by updated `black` to a later version. Running `pre-commit run --all-files` a second time now gives me:\n",
